To build (in the parent folder of old-photo-parallel-A-code where the binnary shall be):
	make -C old-photo-parallel-A-code/

To clean (in the parent folder of old-photo-parallel-A-code: files *.o):
	make clean -C old-photo-parallel-A-code/
	
To clean (in the parent folder of old-photo-parallel-A-code: everything):
	make clean-all -C old-photo-parallel-A-code/
	
Code example:
	./old-photo-parallel-A ./Dataset-1/ 7 -size

Important Notes:
	development was done In VS Code and building, cleaning and testing in a bash shell, side a side. See the code in an IDE, test the code in a shell.
	the Makefile is prepared to build in the parent folder of old-photo-parallel-A-code where the binnary is to be called.
	'paper-texture.png' is to be in old-photo-parallel-A-code.
	in old_photo_PAR_A folder there are intermediate folders with the name with the nest image processing; sepia processing in done into old_photo_PAR_A.
	my system does not have CLOCK_MONOTONIC, used CLOCK_REALTIME instead.
